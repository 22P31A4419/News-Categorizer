# News-Categorizer
A simple machine learning model to classify short news texts into categories like politics, sports, and business using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.
# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a News Categorizer that automatically classifies news articles into predefined categories such as Politics, Sports, Technology, Business, and Entertainment. This system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze the content of news articles and assign the most appropriate category. The goal is to streamline news organization, enhance content discovery, and support applications such as news aggregation, content filtering, and personalized recommendations.
# Overview
This project uses a small sample dataset and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to train a classifier that predicts the category of a given news headline.
# Example
